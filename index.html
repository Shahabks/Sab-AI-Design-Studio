                <p>
                    Designing effective prompts either manually or automatically is challenging and time-consuming. Automatic prompt optimization won't offer flexibility or efficiency. Rather, the building blocks of a RAG-Pipeline should work in harmony to create an effective Knowledge Retrieval system. In this project, we study some potential effective approaches; focusing first on prompts, to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality and specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference.

                <p>
                    Adapting large language models (LLMs) for real-world business scenarios presents challenges. Our empirical study and analysis of this project have demonstrated promising outcomes. In this project, we employed an LLM that was enriched with additional knowledge from insurance policy rulebooks and external sources of knowledge like DBpedia. The enriched LLM exhibited improved understanding of human's structured and domain-specific concepts and enhanced reasoning abilities. The incorporation of domain-specific knowledge significantly enhances the accuracy of GPT-3.5 in insurance question answering tasks. These findings underscore the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge and external resources to effectively address the complexity of business scenarios.

                <p>
                    Subjectivity reflects a person's thoughts and is pivotal when removing unwanted and redundant information in document summarization. This leads to general disagreement over what constitutes a good summary. Our research addresses this subjectivity by proposing a solution for interactive text summarization with preference feedback, empowering machines to better align with human preferences.

                <strong>3D Objects Reconstruction from 2D Drawings - A Metadata Analytical Approach for KOMATSU</strong>
                <br>
                <em>Feb 2021 - Sep 2021</em>
                <p>
                    We addressed three fundamental challenges associated with complex engineering drawings in any CAD formats: extracting information from drawings, integrating the information from different 2D drawings to build related abstracts of the objects in 3D (building metadata), and reconstructing 3D objects with accurate data points which can be fed into machine-numerical-control systems.
